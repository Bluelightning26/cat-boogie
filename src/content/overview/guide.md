One of the most important parts of the process is creating a guide.
Here are our tips and tricks on how to make a great slide deck for your workshop.


### Things to consider when making the presentation:
- Less is more on on the slidedeck, short bullet points help keep the reader's attention
- Let the leader expand on the slide, but also don't make it too sparse to where they are confused
- Make it pretty and consistent! BUT only do this when the content portion is done, it's easy to get caught up on this
  (don't waste too much time on this)
- Add relevant visuals to facilitate the ideas
  - screenshots of what they are looking at
  - diagrams of how things work
  - fun icons
- Ensure the order and the content of the slides are coherent, don't jump around too much and keep a good flow

The guide can be in any technology you'd like, just be mindful that it should be easy for others to present from.\
Some common ones are: Google Slides, Figma, Canva and Powerpoint


### Parts of the slidedeck
- Title
- Introduction
  - What will the participants be making today?
- Recap
  - Dig into their previous knowledge that will be expanded on soon
- New content
  - Teach them something!
  - The main part of the guide/workshop
  - Keep it simple on each slide
  - Break it up into digestible chunks while keeping a good ordered flow
  - Try to not make it overwhelming through introducing too many concepts at once
- Go over submission requirements
- Independent Time
  - Give a general goal for the end: Keeping it clear, concise & fun
  - Allow the members to apply what they learned to create their own unique version of the project
- How to deploy and submit
- What’s next?


### Creating the slides
It's easiest if you start by laying out the general order of the slides that you think are important,
and setting up a framework through this.
The slides can be rearranged later as needed, this is currently just a template.\
This doesn’t have to be an extensive list, but should encompass the main idea


# **(WIP BELOW)**

Add bullet points and images of the code itself if relevant to the slides (the content)

Make the goal of the workshop clear and concise

Let the participants know how to submit and what comes next (probably joining slack)

Themes and visuals!
Make the whole slideshow flow together while looking nice!
Keep the slides consistent with colors, fonts, sizes etc
(optional, but i found this very helpful) Gather all of the visuals you may need on a single slide at one time. This helped me not have to keep hunting around the internet looking for stuff to do.


Go over the slides and proof-read everything and act like you’re a leader presenting (I caught so many little errors when doing this)

Again, this isn’t an extensive list but just a quick framework on how I would go about making workshop slides
This isn’t a perfect or extensive list in anyway but this is just how I went about creating the Swirl slides myself
